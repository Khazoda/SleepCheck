# SleepCheck
Minecraft plugin for advancing the night if majority of players votes to do so. Features **smooth** night to day transition.
## Commands

  ![alt text][sleepcheck]

- **/sleep** or **/skip**
  - during a sleep vote, other players type this command to vote to skip the night
  
- **/nosleep** or **/noskip**
  - if you type this command during a sleep vote, it will instantly be cancelled, and the instigator will be kicked out of their bed. How rude! (Use this is you want to kill mobs during the night or anything similar)
